        <h1>For My Love</h1>
        <p>You mean the world to me, and I want to express my love for you:</p>
        <button id="loveButton">Click to Reveal My Love</button>
        <p id="loveMessage">I love you more than words can express! Your love fills my heart with a warmth that defies expression. It's a feeling so profound, akin to the heartfelt lyrics of Bruno Mars in "Just the Way You Are," where he croons, "When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change, 'cause you're amazing just the way you are." These words resonate with me because they encapsulate my sentiments towards you. Your presence brightens my world, and I cherish every moment we share. I love you more than words can convey, deeper than the oceans, higher than the skies, and broader than the universe. You are the embodiment of perfection in my eyes, and I am endlessly grateful for your presence in my life.</p>
        <p>"When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change,<br>
        'Cause you're amazing just the way you are."</p>
